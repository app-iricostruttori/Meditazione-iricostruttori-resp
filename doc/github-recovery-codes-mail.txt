Hey app-iricostruttori!

Recovery codes are the only way to access your account again. By saving your
recovery codes, you’ll be able to regain access if you:

* Lose your phone
* Delete your authenticator app
* Change your phone number

GitHub Support will not be able to restore access to your account.
